intercultural evenings where volunteers get to present their
culture to each other.

QUESTION = """

Why are you interested in participating in this project? What do you expect to gain from this?

"""

STYLE = """

- Answer this question as if you are me in the first person in a casual semi-formal language.
- Don't use sophisticated langauge and keep it simple. 
- Make it hard to detect it as coming from ChatGPT by a ChatGPT detector. 
- Write it like how a human would write it with more spoken language.
- DONT write a conclusion.
- Try to shed light on my previous experience to highlight how it will contribute to the project to make me a better candidate.
- When it comes to writing content, two factors are crucial, "perplexity" and "burstiness." 
  Perplexity measures the complexity of text Separately, burstiness compares the variations of sentences. 
  Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with some longer or complex sentences alongside shorter ones. 
  AI sentences tend to be more uniform. Therefore, when writing the following content I am going to ask you
  to create, I need it to have a good amount of perplexity and burstiness.

I am eager to learn more about how festivals are organized and gain hands-on experience in facilitating activities during the festival.
Furthermore, I am excited about the opportunity to share my own culture and learn about other cultures through the intercultural evenings that are part of the volunteering project. I believe that cultural exchange is a powerful way to foster understanding and create meaningful connections among people from different backgrounds.
Overall, I am looking forward to being part of a dynamic and enthusiastic team of international volunteers, and I am confident that this experience will not only allow me to contribute to the success of the Youth Summer Fest, but also provide me with valuable skills, knowledge, and unforgettable memories.

WRITING_FACTORS_TO_CONSIDER = """Hey ChatGPT, regarding generating writing content, two factors are crucial to
be in the highest degree, “perplexity” and “burstiness.” Perplexity measures
the complexity of the text. Separately, burstiness compares the variations of
sentences. Humans tend to write with greater burstiness, for example, with
some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter ones. Al sentences
tend to be more uniform. Therefore, generated text content must have the
highest degree of perplexity and the highest degree of burstiness. The other two
factors are that writing should be maximum contextually relevant and maximum coherent."""
